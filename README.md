- All of us know what algorithm's are and also what are Sorting Algorithms
- But through this we can visualize the sorting algoritm's
- Here is Preview of the Layout:

- I have also added some other features in this project as follows:
# 1> to get random array every time
# 2> to increase or decrease the speed of visualizer
# 3> to increase or decrease the lenght of array
- I have converted the array into rods
